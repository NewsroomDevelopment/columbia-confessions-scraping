ALSO EVERYONE SUPPORT THE GRAD STUDENTS\", 'post_text': \"10112. hello everyone. in light of the grad student strike I just wanted to encourage my fellow undergrads NOT to report TAs who decide to strike. being concerned about grades and how the rest of the semester is going to go is valid, but this is something my TA was happy to discuss with us, so you could potentially ask them, rather than reaching out to their departments like we’re told to do deantinis last email. of course this is all your choice, but the university has already basically promised retaliation and I think it’s important as undergrads to stand in solidarity and do what we can to make sure the strike is successful!\\n\\n10113. Is now a good time to apply for a TA position and mention in the application that I won’t strike? Cus if y’all don’t need the money, then I’ll take it.\\nStriking for a shitty TA position is funny. If you’re gonna strike, do it when you’re doing something meaningful in your careers. We all know you don’t become TAs because you LOOOOOVE teaching undergrads. You applied for the job because you wanted to make money while in school and it’s also something to add to your resume. But unless you’re actually going into teaching as a career, then striking over a bumper in life seems dumb. If you are willing to give up your income that easily then don’t apply for the position in the first place, and let someone else who actually needs the money to survive take the job.\\n\\n10114. P.s. most of y’all suck at TAing anyway. so is there a way to get a portion of my tuition back after paying for the shitty job y’all do and have done in every class I’ve taken?\\n\\n10115. i wish everyone who reports their striking TAs a very Die, bootlicker\\n\\n10116. Columbia can kick itself over this grad strike. Not because of “poor conditions” (give me a break), but because Columbia incessantly propagates activism and wokeness. Welp, Columbia, you don’t like this fiasco? Well guess what, you construed it yourself on every level.\\nOf course, it’ll be the Undergrads taking the punch at the end of the day.\\nInstruction continues to get worse, u-grads become even more isolated from the campus and left to feel on their own with their course material, AND don’t think this little strike won’t result in OUR (undergrads) tuition being raised.\\n\\n10117.
