      "10046. Love is so rare. I don’t want to date again. The amount of times I have seen people treat other people like trash, saying the “love” them, is completely ridiculous. Don’t tell me that not all people are like that; sure, but I’m not gonna go fishing through the TRASH just to find that perfect someone when I am clearly going to treat myself better than the rubbish I have seen. Most people don’t even know—or have different definitions of— what love and commitment actually is. Frankly, it’s all just exhausting. I’m so much better off by myself, good lord. 0.9885\n",
