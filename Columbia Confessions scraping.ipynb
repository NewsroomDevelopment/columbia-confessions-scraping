If you’re gonna strike, do it when you’re doing something meaningful in your careers. We all know you don’t become TAs because you LOOOOOVE teaching undergrads. You applied for the job because you wanted to make money while in school and it’s also something to add to your resume. But unless you’re actually going into teaching as a career, then striking over a bumper in life seems dumb. If you are willing to give up your income that easily then don’t apply for the position in the first place, and let someone else who actually needs the money to survive take the job.\\n\\n10114.

There’s no way I’ll survive” as a kindergartener to my teacher. I spent my entire childhood awake at night terrified to sleep and wondering why I was alive or if I would be in the morning and why the world was so messed up. I would pick at my skin and eyelashes constantly. I had the worst anxious belly to the point where if somebody mentioned global warming (which terrified me), I’d almost immediately throw up. That turned into a full blown eating disorder by age 12. If I felt guilty or anxious about anything, I’d take baths or showers for hours at a time so I could talk out my feelings/play out conversations by my self...and cry a lot. I’d have panic attacks about so many things that would manifest as my skin tingling all over and my hearing going funny and this really weird chest/side pain where I just thought I was dying or crazy. For example, until I was in high school, I literally never thought I wasn’t going to die during the preroll at the movies.\\n\\nIdk exactly what to do with this information, because I for sure still have at least moderate anxiety.

Ok, I have something to say about Biden. I\\'ve seen a lot of people already throwing the rhetoric that they regret voting for him because \"\"he\\'s failed\"\" already in many ways. This is true: he ordered air strikes in Syria, he\\'s opening detainment camps for migrant children, he\\'s not being firm on $15 minimum wage, etc.\\n\\nI think what I want to say is that yes Biden and the rest of the moderate democrats suck because they virtue signal by appealing to marginalized groups in insufficient ways and then continue to do atrocities that republicans would do in their sleep. Yes, we need to do whatever we can to pressure moderate democrats to be more progressive and to not further all of America\\'s evils. However, I think it is important to realize that in ~some~ areas Biden is making progress on issues important to the left, and that if the left wants a foothold in American politics, they need to rely on moderate democrats to build it for them.\\n\\nThe For the People Act that is on the table in the senate right now will pave the way for more blue governmental control with automatic voter registration, campaign finance reform, and prohibiting gerrymandering. Bitch McConnell has basically said flat out that he opposes it because it will result in democrats winning more elections. Without Biden-Harris, this bill would have no chance. At least now we have a chance at creating a foothold, and I think that it is impressive to see such a foundational correctional change within 2 months of the Biden presidency (assuming it passes...).\\n\\nBiden also lifted the Muslim ban, and has laid a lot of groundwork for Climate change to be a top issue at the federal level (eh probably too little too late). He\\'s secured enough vaccinations so that there will be enough vaccine for every American by May (he probably had to outbid many other countries for this, so ethically I\\'m iffy about it but I also really want to get that shot).\\n\\nI don\\'t mean to sweep all the issues with moderate democrats under the rug by \"\"looking at the bright side.\"\" I think it\\'s obviously important to be extremely critical of them and call them out for being the hypocrites they are. However, I don\\'t see a way for progressives to get a foothold in this country without swallowing this bitter pill first.', 'sentiment': 0.1167, 'likes': 19, 'comments': 0, 'shares': 0, 'time': '03/09/2021', 'post_url': 'https://facebook.com/columbiaconfessionz/posts/461525491863070', 'confession_num': 10051, '_id': 461525491863070}, {'text': \"10049.

Being a premed is very difficult and I hope some of you that you are reading this find this helpful. I started studying for the MCAT in my senior year, I took the MCAT 3 times and despite my high GPA, 3.92, and being neuro major at Barnard my score kept declining (506, 499 and 487). After a year and half of trying and going through hours and hours of prep time my score kept going lower. I started seeing a psychologyist about this as i was crying number of times per day and I wasn't in a good place, after only two sessions my therapist was able to point out what has been my issue and what has elevated my anxiety level to this level. I've found myself the victim of bullying and belittling by my tutor (Scott R). For a year and half I subjected myself to someone to talk down on me both in group classes and private sessions, making me lose my self-esteem and generated unparalleled level of anxiety in me. Make fun of me everytime I get a question wrong... I started looking up to see if I can find any information or reviews from other students on him but there is literally no reviews on this dude not on Google nor on yelp or any other places. I left a negative review on his Google listing to help others and protect others from what I went through but he deleted the listing and start a new listing. I know other Barnard students go to him and they Subject themselves to his unkind behavior.\\n\\nI took the MCAT for the 4th time and I am happy to say I got 516.
